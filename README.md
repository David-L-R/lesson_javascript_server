## What is it

A server - A machine that waits for requests and sends responses.

A Client - An application that request data (and web pages). Usually something like a browser.

## Today's Goals

1. Use code written by others with NPM.
1. Make a server that sends a webpage with `ExpressJS`.

## NPM

- install npm
- `npm -v`
- `npm install <package_name>`
- running the program (`node <file_name>`)
- add and run script

## Create an Express Server

- Create an express server
- Run and listen on port
- `localhost:3000`
- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` (CRUD)
- `app.get` a route
- check `req.method`
- return a string
- return HTML
